   		 "We addict players for their own enjoyment."
			     September 19, 1993


NEW COMMANDS AND NEW MUD BEHAVIOR:
---------------------------------

**  Your character no longer gains move points with age.  However, age
    does still affect your HMV gains.  Also, move point modifier objects
    now work correctly.

**  You can now use "all" and "all.x" very generally with the get, put,
    drop, junk, donate, give, wear and remove commands.  Type HELP GET
    for more info.

**  The "track" function will show you the first step on the shortest
    path to anyone in the game.

**  If you drop your link for more than 1 hour, you will be force-rented
    at 25% greater than normal rent prices.  If you don't have enough
    money to rent with, your most valuable items will be junked until
    the money you have can cover your items.

**  You can now remove your own messages from the board.  Also, if you
    put someone else's name in parentheses in the message header, they
    will be able to remove the message too.

**  The MIDGAARD MAIL SYSTEM is now complete.  The Post Office is north
    of the entrance to the Grunting Boar inn.  Stamps cost 150 coins.

**  Fountains have now been implemented.  You can drink from fountains
    or fill containers from fountains using the FILL command.

**  The SHOUT command, as always, only reaches people in your zone (you
    can see who these people are by typing WHERE).  The HOLLER command
    reaches everyone in the game but costs 10 movement points.

**  When you are writing a message, you will now not be interrupted
    by tells, shouts, emotes, socials, and even people talking in the
    same room.

**  The WIMPY command has been upgraded so you can set at how many hit
    points you flee.  Type HELP WIMPY for more info.

*****************************************************************************
    IF YOU LEAVE THE GAME FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, either by renting or plain
    quitting, your hit points, move points, and mana will be fully restored
    when you come back!  This doesn't work if you're poisoned.
*****************************************************************************

**  Use the ASSIST command to engage in mortal combat with someone in the
    room who is getting pummeled.

**  Use the SPLIT command to split gold among the members of your group
    (including yourself) who are in the room.  i.e. If you are in a group
    with 4 other people who are in the room with you, type "SPLIT 100"
    to give each of them 20 coins.

**  You can use the VISIBLE command to break a spell of invisibility before
    it expires.
